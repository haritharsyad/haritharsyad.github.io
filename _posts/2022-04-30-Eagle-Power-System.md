For my Power Systems Analysis I course, me and my team worked on the Eagle power system which includes 17 buses. We had to work on the branches to connect all of the buses, assigning the buses as Swing bus, Load bus and Generator buses. We then moved on to performing load flow analysis for 3 different tasks. The first one being a normal condition load flow, second one by adding a 40 MW load to the system and increasing the loads of all the other buses by 40% and then running a load flow analysis for that. The third task was performing different contingencies, N-1 contingency consisted of eliminating the branch between bus 5 and bus 11 and then N-2 contingency included the OWL generator outage

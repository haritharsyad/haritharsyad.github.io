The goal of the project is to design and fabricate a device that can speed up signals in optic cable applications via the use of high speed magnetic pulses and magneto-optic material. The device will be capable of producing magnetic field pulses greater than or equal to 500 gauss within 100 nanoseconds, will be powered by a source voltage of less than or equal to 15 Volts DC, and will be less than 3.5” by 2” in physical size. Given the design requirements and resources from the previous iterations of this project, we plan to create an improved design including a reduced rise time of 10ns, functional programmable control of the magnetic field generation, reduced overall noise, and increased stability.

## Responsibility

A degree or certificate from an accredited trade school is usually considered essential for a graphic design position. After a career history has been established, though, the graphic designer's experience and number of years in the business are considered the primary qualifications. A portfolio, which is the primary method for demonstrating these qualifications, is usually required to be shown at job interviews, and is constantly developed throughout a designer's career.

Ice molecules can exhibit up to sixteen different phases _(packing geometries)_ that depend on temperature and pressure. When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three different types of amorphous ice can form depending on the history of its pressure and temperature. When cooled slowly correlated proton tunneling occurs below 20 K giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena. Virtually all the ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as "ice one h") with minute traces of cubic ice denoted as ice Ic. The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0°C (273.15K, 32°F) at standard atmospheric pressure. It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost. The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.

## Application

This device will be used in networking systems to increase the bandwidth of the system by using magneto-optic switching. This concept uses Faraday effect, which is a change in the polarization of the travelling EM wave caused by optic cable caused by an outside EM field. Since this switching is faster than current systems used, we can achieve a larger bandwidth in our network. For the users of this system, since the bandwidth is larger and can host more users, this system will be cheaper. A similar example is how current internet systems are switching to fiber optic systems.

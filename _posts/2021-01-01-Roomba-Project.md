In this project, I worked in a team of six in order to program a Roomba that can navigate a randomized test field. We programmed a microcontroller to take in measurements from various sensors such as the IR sensor and ping sensor so that we can map out the field and avoid obstacles to reach the end goal in the test field.

##Responsibility

In this project, I coded the manual driving of the Roomba as well as created a user interface that displays the measurements from all the sensors nicely into putty. I also worked on the logic the Roomba uses to determine where the obstacles are on the test field. In this project, I learned how to code in C and also learned a lot about microcontrollers and how to use the datasheets of microcontrollers. I also learned a lot about working in a team environment on coding projects and how to set up a workflow with GitHub and other resources.
